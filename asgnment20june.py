Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user.
The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a userâ€™s data.
Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.
The only parties that should ever see the access token are the application itself, the authorization server, and resource server.
